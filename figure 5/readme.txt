To generate data for the plots shown in figure 5

Run  "optimizerwithlhssampling_3inputs.m", "optimizerwithlhssampling_5inputs.m", initially which generates groundtruth thermodynamic model data for three and 5 input nodes to be approximated by the RPM and Hillcube models


once the data is generated , run "main.m"

to plot the histograms 

plot histograms run "histogramplot.m"
